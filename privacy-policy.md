# BillBucket – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 27 November 2025_

BillBucket (“the App”) is a personal finance tool that helps you track recurring bills on your device. This Privacy Policy explains what data the App handles, how it is stored, and your choices.

By using BillBucket, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

BillBucket is designed to work **locally on your device**. It does **not** require you to create an account or provide personal identity details (name, address, etc.).

The App may store the following information **only on your device**:

- Bill names (e.g., “Rent”, “Netflix”)
- Bill amounts
- Bill frequency (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.)
- Due dates and paid dates
- Optional notes or labels (if you add them)

This data is stored locally using on-device storage (e.g., a local database) and is not automatically uploaded to any external server by the App.

BillBucket does **not**:

- Collect or store passwords
- Collect government IDs or tax information
- Collect payment card numbers or bank account numbers
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or files

---

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

The data you enter into BillBucket is used **only** to provide the core functionality of the App, including:

- Listing your bills and their due dates
- Calculating suggested monthly or weekly amounts to set aside
- Showing summaries and upcoming bill information

All of this processing happens on your device.

We do **not**:

- Sell your data
- Share your data with advertisers
- Use your data for third-party analytics

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All bill data is stored **locally on your device** in an app-specific storage area.

- Other apps cannot directly read this data under normal operating system restrictions.
- If you uninstall BillBucket, the locally stored data is typically deleted by the operating system.
- If you reset or change your device, your data will **not** automatically transfer unless you use a system-level backup/restore solution provided by your device/OS.

Because BillBucket does not run its own servers, we do not store or control your data on any remote systems.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

BillBucket may use third-party libraries to provide core app functionality (for example, UI components or basic system integrations), but:

- These libraries are used within the app code.
- They are **not** used to send your bill data to external servers for processing, profiling, or advertising.

If in future versions any online services are added (for example, cloud sync or analytics), this Privacy Policy will be updated clearly to describe what is collected and why.

---

## 5. Permissions Used

Depending on platform and configuration, the App may request certain permissions:

- **Network / Internet access**  
  - Used only to:
    - Open external links you tap (e.g., GitHub repository, email link, or store page).
  - The App does **not** automatically upload your bill data using this permission.

- **Notifications (optional)**  
  - If notification functionality is enabled in a future version, this permission will be used to show bill reminders on your device.
  - Notification content (e.g., bill name and amount) is generated locally.

BillBucket does **not** request access to contacts, photos, media, or location.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

BillBucket is a general-purpose personal finance tool and is **not directed at children**. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Because no account system or central server is used, the developer has no direct way to identify or verify user age.

---

## 7. Your Choices and Control

Because all your data is stored locally on your device:

- You can edit or delete bills directly within the App.
- To remove all data, you can:
  - Delete your bills manually in the App, and/or
  - Uninstall BillBucket from your device (which typically removes all app data).

If you use any system-level backup service, your device backup may contain a copy of the App’s local data according to your OS settings.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect:

- Changes in app features
- Changes in legal or regulatory requirements
- Clarifications or improvements to the wording

When changes are made:

- The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised.
- A new version of the Privacy Policy will be published on the same GitHub Pages URL or repository.
